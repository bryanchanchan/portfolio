text2: Since the concept of virtual reality I’ve came up with, I was I could mix some of the real life object and some surreal illustration to create feel of something going into the world where things aren’t real. I’ve included hands that are real and re-creating their hands by illustrating 3 different character's hand. Then I have also came up with a background that is something representing the virtual world.
